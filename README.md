## Welcome to the Introduction to CloudLab Workshop!!!

Prior to attending the workshop, please make sure that you have completed the following preparatory steps:

** Step 1: Software prerequisites **

- This workshop will use Python 2.7 and Jupyter Notebook. If you already have these installed, you can skip this step. If not, you can download a copy of Anaconda for Python 2.7 [here](<https://www.continuum.io/downloads>) and install it on your machine. 

- You will need to have access to a terminal that support SSH key generation. For MacOS X and Linux users, the default terminal is satisfactory. For Windows users, [MobaXterm](mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended. 

** Step 2: Download workshop materials **

- Download the [workshop materials](https://github.com/clemsonciti/cloudlab-workshop/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Go into the unzipped directory and continue unzipping the `emulab-0.9.zip` file. Do not change the name of the unzipped directory. 

** Step 3: Set up geni-lib library to enable creation of CloudLab profiles via Python programming **

- Open up a terminal (or a command prompt for Windows users)
- Go to the unzipped directory of the workshop materials
- Type `jupyter notebook`. This will launch a Jupyter Server whose home page contains the contents of the workshop directory. 
- Click on file `0-preparations.ipynb` to open this notebook. Execute all the cells as instructed in the notebook.
